# Grade Runner — Project Plan

> An ultra-marathon pacing web app. Upload a course GPX, get a sustainable
> grade-adjusted pacing plan (splits + finish time) constrained by your aerobic
> ceiling **and** your fuel/energy balance. Plus an analysis mode that replays a
> real run's energy balance and flags bonk risk.

**Status:** Design complete, not yet implemented. This doc is self-contained —
you can resume the build from scratch on any machine using only this file. (All
equations were extracted from the Minetti 2002 paper; you do **not** need the PDF
to continue.)

**Name:** Grade Runner (chosen). **Delivery:** Vite + React + TypeScript,
containerized with Docker so it runs with no local dependency setup.

## 1. Vision / requirements

From the user:

1. Browser app to find pacing for ultra marathons given a GPX file.
2. Use Minetti et al. 2002 energy-cost data for uphill/downhill running.
3. Find the **sustainable grade-adjusted pace** given calorie intake per hour and
   energy used when running.
4. Let the user input **LT1, LT2, and fat oxidation at different paces**; use these
   to find the sustainable pace.
5. Must be useful **without** that data — make sensible default assumptions.
6. **Analysis mode**: input the GPX of an actual run and see the energy balance
   during the race.
7. Cool name (→ "Grade Runner").
8. There should be some grade (or speed) at which we switch from running to
   walking — research-backed (see §6).

## 2. The science (extracted from Minetti et al. 2002, J Appl Physiol 93:1039–1046)

Gradient `i` is dimensionless = rise / horizontal-run (e.g. 0.10 = 10% grade).

**Energy cost of running** per unit distance (J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹), valid −0.45 ≤ i ≤ 0.45:

```
Cr(i) = 155.4·i⁵ − 30.4·i⁴ − 43.3·i³ + 46.3·i² + 19.5·i + 3.6     (R² = 0.999)
```
- `Cr(0) = 3.6` (flat). Minimum ≈ 1.7–1.8 around **i ≈ −0.10 to −0.20** (gentle
  downhill is genuinely cheapest — this is correct, not a bug).

**Energy cost of walking** (J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹):

```
Cw(i) = 280.5·i⁵ − 58.7·i⁴ − 76.8·i³ + 51.9·i² + 19.6·i + 2.5     (R² = 0.999)
```
- `Cw(0) = 2.5`. Note Cw < Cr per-meter at almost all gradients, but walking is
  **speed-limited** (~2 m/s max) — that's what makes the walk/run choice non-trivial.

**Max sustainable speed at gradient i:** `v_i = Ė_submax / Cr(i)`
where `Ė_submax` = sustainable **net** metabolic power (W/kg).

**Sustainable fraction of aerobic power vs event duration** (Saltin):
`fract = (940 − t_min) / 1000`. ⚠️ Goes negative past ~15.6 h — **replace** for
ultras (see §5, P0 fix).

**Altitude correction** (Cerretelli), fraction of VO₂max available at altitude `alt` (m):
`fract_altitude = 1 − 11.7e-9·alt² − 4.01e-6·alt`
(≈0.94 at 2000 m, ≈0.80 at 4000 m). Apply **per-segment** using each point's elevation.

**O₂ energy equivalent:** ~20.9 kJ per L O₂ (RER 0.96). Note this is the carb value;
fat ≈ 19.6 kJ/L (see §5, P1). 1 MET ≈ 3.5 ml O₂·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ ≈ 1.22 W/kg.

## 3. Tech stack & architecture

- **Vite + React + TypeScript** SPA. All computation client-side (no backend).
- **Charts:** Recharts (downsample rendered series to ~800 pts; keep full-res data
  for math). Consider uPlot if perf becomes an issue on big GPX files.
- **GPX parsing:** parse XML directly (`DOMParser`) or `@tmcw/togeojson`; extract
  lat/lon/ele/time.
- **State:** local component state / lightweight store (Zustand if it grows).
  Persist inputs to `localStorage`. No accounts.
- **Docker:** multi-stage build (node → build static bundle; nginx to serve).
  `docker compose up` → app on `localhost:8080`. Works offline once built.

## 4. The two modes

### Planning mode
1. Upload **course** GPX → pipeline (parse, resample to fixed distance, smooth
   elevation, compute windowed gradient, clamp to ±0.45).
2. Solve for the sustainable plan (see §5): choose a single effort knob `θ`,
   forward-simulate the whole course, bisect θ to the largest value that keeps
   glycogen above reserve everywhere and power ≤ ceiling.
3. Output: per-segment pace & mode (run/walk), cumulative time, predicted finish,
   split table, elevation profile with pace overlay, fuel/glycogen curve, and the
   distance/time where a bonk would occur if under-fueled.

### Analysis mode
1. Upload GPX of an **actual run** (needs timestamps).
2. Reconstruct per-segment speed → metabolic power → carb/fat split → glycogen
   depletion given the user's fueling.
3. Output: energy-balance timeline (glycogen remaining, cumulative carb deficit,
   fat vs carb contribution), moving vs elapsed time, and a bonk flag with the
   point it happened / would have happened.
4. Handle pauses (auto-detect low speed / time gaps → resting metabolism, excluded
   from moving pace but counted in elapsed time and fuel absorption).

## 5. Physiological model — final design (with corrections)

The core structural decision from model review: **don't algebraically "intersect"
the aerobic and fuel constraints — simulate, then bisect.** Aerobic limit is an
instantaneous power cap; fuel is a cumulative reservoir with a flow limit, so it
must hold at *every* instant, not just at the finish.

**Solver:**
1. One scalar effort knob `θ` = target fraction of the (grade- & altitude-varying)
   aerobic ceiling. `P_target(seg) = θ · P_ceiling(seg)`.
2. Forward-simulate the course at θ: speed → power → carb/fat split → deplete
   glycogen (with gut inflow) → accumulate time.
3. Feasible iff power ≤ ceiling everywhere (guaranteed if θ ≤ 1) **and**
   glycogen(t) ≥ reserve for all t.
4. **Bisect on θ** for the largest feasible value → that's the plan. This auto-resolves
   the duration↔pace↔fraction↔glycogen coupling that no closed-form intersection can.

**P0 corrections (must-do):**
- **Net vs gross consistency.** Minetti Cr is *net* (rest subtracted). VO₂max ceiling
  is *gross*. Add resting metabolism `P_rest ≈ 1.2 W/kg`; use gross everywhere:
  `P_gross = Cr(i)·v + P_rest`; ceiling `P_ceiling = fract · VO2max · 20.9/60` (W/kg, gross).
- **Replace Saltin fraction** (goes negative for long ultras) with bounded decay:
  `fract(t) = f_inf + (f0 − f_inf)·exp(−t/τ)`, defaults `f0 = 0.94`, `f_inf ≈ 0.38`,
  `τ ≈ 250 min`. Always cap by LT2. Let the user calibrate to one recent race.
- **Fuel = reservoir + flow limit, in grams.** Track glycogen forward:
  `dGly/dt = carb_in_ox − carb_demand`, floored at reserve (~60 g).
  Exogenous carb is **gut-limited independent of intake**:
  `carb_in_ox = min(intake_g_per_h, gut_max)`, `gut_max ≈ 60 g/h` (glucose) to
  ~90 g/h (glucose+fructose). Intake above gut_max is wasted (GI distress), not fuel.
  Bonk = glycogen hits reserve → sustainable power collapses to `fat_ceiling + exogenous_carb`.

**Fat oxidation — energy-conserving default (P1).** Model the substrate split as a
**carbohydrate energy fraction** (conserves energy by construction), then apply an
absolute fat-rate ceiling on top. With `x = %VO2max`:
```
fC(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(−k·(x − x0)))
```
Anchored to thresholds (defaults LT1 = 0.65, LT2 = 0.85 of VO₂max):
- `x0 = LT1` (so fC(LT1) = 0.5)
- `k = ln(9) / (LT2 − LT1) ≈ 11`  (so fC(LT2) ≈ 0.9)

Then `carb_rate = fC(x)·P_gross`, `fat_rate = (1−fC(x))·P_gross`, subject to
`fat_rate ≤ FO_peak·37.7 kJ/g` (default `FO_peak ≈ 0.55 g/min`, elites ~1.0). If fat
is capped, the shortfall is forced onto carbs — this is the mechanism that makes hard
efforts glycogen-expensive and drives the bonk.
- **User fat-ox data:** convert each (intensity, g/min) point to an energy fraction;
  ≥3 pts → fit `(x0,k)` or monotone PCHIP on fC; 1–2 pts → shift/scale the default logistic.

**Other P1/P2 corrections:**
- **Beyond ±0.45**, don't extrapolate the polynomial (it explodes) — clamp `i`, then
  add a linear vertical-cost term ≈ `9.81/0.25 ≈ 39 J/kg per vertical m` for climbing
  so steep pitches degrade gracefully instead of flat-lining.
- **Distance convention:** gradient uses horizontal (haversine) run; cost/speed/splits
  use **along-slope 3D distance** `run·√(1+i²)` (matches Minetti's belt distance). Pick once, be consistent.
- **Energy bookkeeping in Joules**, partition into carb-J / fat-J, convert with
  16.7 kJ/g (carb), 37.7 kJ/g (fat). (Avoids the ~4–7% O₂-equivalent inconsistency.)
- **Altitude per-segment** (Cerretelli on each point's elevation), not once globally.
- **Analysis-mode speed:** smooth speed on the same distance grid as elevation; detect
  stops (speed < ~0.5 m/s or time gaps) → resting power, no phantom movement.
- **Optional durability drift** (biggest ultra-specific effect missing otherwise):
  `Ė_sus(t) = Ė_sus·(1 − d·hours)`, off by default.

**GPX pipeline:** resample to fixed 3D spacing first; distance-based elevation
smoothing (rolling median / Savitzky–Golay over ~30–50 m); gradient = rise over a
~20–50 m window (never point-to-point — that's pure noise). Report total gain *after*
smoothing; let the user calibrate smoothing/scale to a known course vertical. Missing
elevation → warn / flat-course fallback. Missing timestamps → planning only.

## 6. Walk ⇄ run transition — research + recommendation

The user specifically asked for literature. Findings:

- **Minetti, Ardigò & Saibene 1994**, *The transition between walking and running in
  humans: metabolic and mechanical aspects at different gradients*, Acta Physiol Scand
  150:315–323 (this is ref 21 in our 2002 paper). They measured, at each gradient, both
  the **metabolically-equivalent speed** Sm (where Cw = Cr) and the **spontaneous
  transition speed** Ss. Both **decrease as gradient increases**, and people
  spontaneously switch ~0.5–0.9 km/h *below* the metabolic-equivalence speed.
- **Level walk↔run transition ≈ 2.0 m/s (~7.2–7.6 km/h).** A gradient study
  (±5%, PMC4575035) found the energetically-optimal transition speed is ~7.5 km/h and
  barely changes over ±5% (downhill slightly faster). So near-flat, ~2 m/s is a solid anchor.
- **Practical trail heuristic:** most runners should walk once grade exceeds
  **~15–20%** (≈15° ≈ 27% for the steepest estimates); at +20–30% walking is more
  economical than running for nearly everyone; elites hold running a bit steeper.

**Recommendation (implement this — no magic grade constant):** let the transition
*emerge* from a walking-speed cap, which reproduces the literature:
```
v_run(i)  = min( P_net / Cr(i), v_descent_max(i) )   # v_descent_max = ∞ above i ≈ -0.10
v_walk(i) = min( v_walk_max , P_net / Cw(i) )        # v_walk_max ≈ 2.0 m/s
mode      = argmax(v_run, v_walk)                     # faster mode at equal power wins
```
On the flat, `v_run ≫ 2` → run. As grade steepens, `v_run` collapses below walking
speed and Cw < Cr → walk. The crossover falls out at ~15–25% grade (fitness-dependent
via P_net and `v_walk_max`), matching the studies. Expose `v_walk_max` and a
"force walk above X% grade" override as user settings.

**Descent speed cap (implemented, `model/minetti.ts` `maxDescentSpeedMs`):** Minetti's
data is metabolic cost measured on a smooth, motor-driven treadmill at an *imposed*
speed — it says nothing about whether a real trail runner can safely control their
body at the speed their aerobic budget alone would allow on a real descent. Without a
separate limit, `v_run(i) = P_net / Cr(i)` blows up right at Cr(i)'s minimum
(i ≈ −0.10 to −0.20): a large-but-plausible power budget divided by ~1.8 J/kg/m
implies sub-2:30/km paces on ordinary trail descents, which no one actually runs.
`v_descent_max(i)` is an independent, non-metabolic ceiling (braking/eccentric
control, footing, technical terrain — this *is* the "descent-fatigue penalty...
not captured by Minetti" flagged above) that only engages below i ≈ −0.10, so mild
downhill and everything else is untouched. It's a speed limit, not an added energy
cost, so it doesn't distort glycogen/fat-burn accounting (including Analysis mode,
which uses actual recorded speed and never calls this function at all). Roughly
calibrated against one recorded 55 km trail ultra's actual GPS pace vs. grade — real
signal, but a single noisy data point, not a validated constant like Minetti's own
curve. Not yet exposed as a user setting (see §7); a strong technical descender and a
cautious one likely warrant different values.

## 7. User-editable parameters & zero-input defaults

| Param | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg | |
| VO₂max | 50 ml/kg/min | or infer from a recent race |
| LT1 / LT2 (%VO₂max) | 0.65 / 0.85 | anchors fat curve + ceiling cap |
| Duration→fraction curve | f0 0.94, f_inf 0.38, τ 250 min | calibrate to one race |
| Carb intake | 60 g/h | fueling plan |
| Gut oxidation max | 60 g/h (90 mixed) | caps exogenous carb, separate from intake |
| Glycogen store | ~7–8 g/kg ⇒ ~500 g | + fed/fasted start fraction |
| Glycogen reserve floor | 60 g | bonk threshold |
| FO_peak (fat rate ceiling) | 0.55 g/min | ~1.0 for elites |
| Resting metabolism | 1.2 W/kg | net→gross bridge |
| Walk max speed / force-walk grade | 2.0 m/s / off | |
| Smoothing window / segment length | 40 m / 50 m | |
| Altitude adjustment | on | Cerretelli per-segment |
| Durability drift | off | decay Ė_sus over hours |

Everything above the fold works with zero physiology input; accuracy improves as the
user supplies LT1/LT2, fat-ox points, and a calibration race.

## 8. Build steps (suggested order)

1. Scaffold Vite + React + TS. Add Recharts.
2. `model/minetti.ts` + unit tests (check Cr(0)=3.6, Cw(0)=2.5, min near −0.1..−0.2,
   clamp/extrapolation beyond ±0.45).
3. `gpx/pipeline.ts`: parse → resample → smooth → windowed gradient → pause detect.
   Test with a real GPX; verify total gain is sane after smoothing.
4. `model/energetics.ts`, `substrate.ts`, `ceiling.ts` (+ tests for net/gross, fuel
   conservation, fraction curve staying positive).
5. `model/solver.ts`: walk/run choice, forward sim, bisection. Sanity-check finish
   times against a known race.
6. UI: upload, elevation profile, inputs panel, mode toggle, split table, fuel chart.
7. Analysis mode reconstruction + energy-balance timeline.
8. Dockerfile + docker-compose + nginx; verify `docker compose up` serves the built app.

## 9. Verification

- Unit tests for all `model/*` pure functions (Vitest).
- Cr(0)=3.6, Cw(0)=2.5; Cr minimum near i≈−0.1..−0.2; energy conservation
  (carb-J + fat-J = total-J each step); glycogen never negative; fraction curve
  stays in (0,1] for 24 h+.
- End-to-end: load a real ultra GPX, produce a plan, eyeball splits/finish against a
  known result; toggle analysis mode on a run with timestamps and confirm the
  bonk/energy-balance curve is plausible.
- `docker compose up` → open `localhost:8080`, upload GPX, see a plan. Works offline.

## 10. How to resume on another PC

You only need this file — all equations and the model are captured above.

1. Copy this `PLAN.md` (and optionally the Minetti PDF) to the new machine.
2. Point Claude Code at it: "Read PLAN.md and start building Grade Runner from
   §8 build steps." Begin with the Vite scaffold + `model/minetti.ts` + tests.
3. Open decisions already made: name = **Grade Runner**; stack = Vite+React+TS,
   Dockerized; model = simulate-and-bisect (§5); walk/run = emergent speed-cap (§6).
